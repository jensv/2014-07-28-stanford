It's pretty obvious that if we want to be sure our programs are right, we need to put in some effort. What isn't so obvious is that focusing on quality is also the best way—in fact, the only way—to improve productivity as well. Getting something wrong and then fixing it almost always takes longer than getting it right in the first place. Designing testable code, practicing defensive programming, writing and running tests, and thinking about what the right answer is supposed to be all help get us answers faster, as well as ones that are more likely to be correct.
